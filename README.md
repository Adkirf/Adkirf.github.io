<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is a basic but nicely designed Portfolio. I used mostly HTML and CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript for some of the dynamic content. The JS is kept very basic, as the primary focus for now is HTML and CSS. 
This is my first real project, and my entry into the coding community. Therefore I wanted to build a solid MVP, that is presentable, functional and a foundation for my future development. So if you are new into coding you can use this project to better understand basic HTML function and animation, and how implement first interactive dynamics with JS. If go through the code&website and tell me what you think :)

I want to learn and improve my programming skills by creating new projects. Each project will focus on a specific new skill/tool/feature and designed minimalistic as a MVPP. The new knowledge and projoject will than be implemented and linked into this portfolio. This way I will iterate fast through my to-learn list, and quickly enhance this portfolio's content and functionalities.

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

- [ ] Minor improvements of the content and sizes
      <br>Links, images, text and sizes of the elements. 
- [ ] Improve mobile experience <br> 
      While the design sizes are responsive, the hover animations of the web format are not well trasnlated into the mobile format. 
- [ ] More JavaScript <br> 
      I want to make the overall website more dynamic and interactive and         train my JS skills. 
- [ ] Integrate API <br> 
      Use one or more APIs to host the content outside the website source         code. 
- [ ] Build and link more projects

## Acknowledgments

The basic structure was created by following this great tutorial from the FreeCodeCamp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV7S8BhIeBo&t=531s.
After following along, I started to customize compontents until I reached a point where the portfolio felt like "my" project.
The second ressource that was very helpful was this hover library https://github.com/IanLunn/Hover/blob/master/css/hover.css.
