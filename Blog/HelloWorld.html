                    Today I designed my first algorithm ! ðŸ’¯ </br>

                    Solution to be found:  </br>
                    Scroll through a list of projects, display the current/last/next item (if existing), and update the switch buttons accordingly. </br>
                    
                    Condition: </br>
                    Handle both directions with 1 function. </br>
                    
                    Here is the result âœ¨ </br>
                    <video controls> <source src="DemoVideo.mp4"> </video>  </br>
                    First I add  a "click listener" to the switch buttons to trigger the function. 

                    Only 1 function, so we pass a bool to indicate the direction we want to go: true = forwards. 
                    
                    The function updates the items, and returns true if there is still an item left in the direction we go
                    The puzzle really is about the start/end of the list.

                    1) At the extreme we can not access the last/next item, as it does not exist. 
                    
                    2) And when reaching the extreme, we need to update our switch buttons, to disable going further.
                    I made use of the return value of the replace function, which is true if successfull. So I loop through the list removing the last/next when forwards/backwards, and replacing current with the next/last item. 
                    When replace = true we almost finished. 
                    The last thing is to check if there is a one more item left. If so, we can update it, and return true to signal that our switch button needs to stay. If there is no item left, we just return false, and disable the switch button to this direction.
                    This is my first algorithm so I guess there are even better solutions. Please let me know if you have one ðŸ™Œ

                    Would love to get your feedback.
